    How I managed the standard OWASP security principles
</p>
<div class="content">

    <h1>
        Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
        The OWASP top 10 is a list of the 10 most found vulnerabilities. I am going to explain what every vulnerability
        is and what some measures are to counter this vulnerability. After that, I say how I managed to secure this in
        the R&D project.
    </p>

    <h1>
        1. Injection
    </h1>
    <p>
        The most common vulnerability is a way of injecting things. The most common is a form of SQL injection. Adding
        ' OR '1'='1 to a injectable query, will always return true, because 1 is always equal to 1. Exploiting this
        further, will result into records that can be changed or gotten.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Usage of prepared statements</li>
        <li>Using a trusted, updated framework (ORM) will most of the time solve it</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        I used the ORM Spring Boot JPA. This is a widely used framework that handles everything in terms of database.
        Since my API is built in Spring Boot Web, this is the best framework to use at this point.
    </p>

    <h1>
        2. Broken Authentication
    </h1>
    <p>
        Authentication that has a vulnerability in it. This can be caused by doing frontend validation, by not
        sending/receiving the right information or by not validating every request for authentication tokens. Another
        vulnerability in this section can be that the users are allowed to enter weak passwords.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Validating Authorization header as interceptor (default every request)</li>
        <li>Usage of frameworks</li>
        <li>Password policy (minimal 8 characters)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        To solve this, I created an authentication microservice. This microservice handles both authentication as
        authorization. More information about this subject can be found in <a href="randd">R&D project</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>
        3. Sensitive data exposure
    </h1>
    <p>
        Personal data can easily be shared. If the viewmodel give wrong or more information than necessary, it will most
        likely be too much. This can always contain sensitive data.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating diagrams and maintaining a wiki on what data is sent back</li>
        <li>Encrypt/hash sensitive data that cannot be shared in any way</li>
        <li>Work testdriven; only add the functionality required to solve the tests</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sensitive data (flags and passwords) are salted and hashed using BCrypt. BCrypt is currently the best choice for
        hashing. I never send the whole object back, always create viewmodels with the data that is required by the
        frontend.
    </p>

    <h1>
        4. XML External Entities (XXE)
    </h1>
    <p>
        This vulnerability is based on older systems. External XML entities can be used to disclose internal files using
        the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service
        attacks.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Upgrade systems to latest version</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        All systems are upgraded to the latest versions.
    </p>

    <h1>
        5. Broken access control
    </h1>
    <p>
        Every time you access new resources or try to create new resources, your role needs to be validated if it has
        sufficient rights to access the query. If this is not done properly or it is only done by the frontend, you can
        get administrator rights as a normal user.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Using frameworks like JWT to validate that the roles are not changed</li>
        <li>Using frameworks like Spring Security to validate that the role inside the token is correct</li>
        <li>Defining every endpoint to need maximum privileges, unless told otherwise so the developer always need to
            think about which roles are allowed to do the thing they intent to do
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        For my authorization, I used JWT. This token is encrypted with RSA, so impossible to change the values
        (<a href="randd">R&D project</a>).
    </p>
