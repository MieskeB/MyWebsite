    How I managed the standard OWASP security principles
</p>
<div class="content">

    <h1>
        Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
        The OWASP top 10 is a list of the 10 most found vulnerabilities. I am going to explain what every vulnerability
        is and what some measures are to counter this vulnerability. After that, I say how I managed to secure this in
        the R&D project.
    </p>

    <h1>
        1. Injection
    </h1>
    <p>
        The most common vulnerability is a way of injecting things. The most common is a form of SQL injection. Adding
        ' OR '1'='1 to a injectable query, will always return true, because 1 is always equal to 1. Exploiting this
        further, will result into records that can be changed or gotten.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Usage of prepared statements</li>
        <li>Using a trusted, updated framework (ORM) will most of the time solve it</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        I used the ORM Spring Boot JPA. This is a widely used framework that handles everything in terms of database.
        Since my API is built in Spring Boot Web, this is the best framework to use at this point.
    </p>

    <h1>
        2. Broken Authentication
    </h1>
    <p>
        Authentication that has a vulnerability in it. This can be caused by doing frontend validation, by not
        sending/receiving the right information or by not validating every request for authentication tokens. Another
        vulnerability in this section can be that the users are allowed to enter weak passwords.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Validating Authorization header as interceptor (default every request)</li>
        <li>Usage of frameworks</li>
        <li>Password policy (minimal 8 characters)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        To solve this, I created an authentication microservice. This microservice handles both authentication as
        authorization. More information about this subject can be found in <a href="randd">R&D project</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>
        3. Sensitive data exposure
    </h1>
    <p>
        Personal data can easily be shared. If the viewmodel give wrong or more information than necessary, it will most
        likely be too much. This can always contain sensitive data.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating diagrams and maintaining a wiki on what data is sent back</li>
        <li>Encrypt/hash sensitive data that cannot be shared in any way</li>
        <li>Work testdriven; only add the functionality required to solve the tests</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sensitive data (flags and passwords) are salted and hashed using BCrypt. BCrypt is currently the best choice for
        hashing. I never send the whole object back, always create viewmodels with the data that is required by the
        frontend.
    </p>

    <h1>
        4. XML External Entities (XXE)
    </h1>
    <p>
        This vulnerability is based on older systems. External XML entities can be used to disclose internal files using
        the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service
        attacks.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Upgrade systems to latest version</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        All systems are upgraded to the latest versions.
    </p>

    <h1>
        5. Broken access control
    </h1>
    <p>
        Every time you access new resources or try to create new resources, your role needs to be validated if it has
        sufficient rights to access the query. If this is not done properly or it is only done by the frontend, you can
        get administrator rights as a normal user.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Using frameworks like JWT to validate that the roles are not changed</li>
        <li>Using frameworks like Spring Security to validate that the role inside the token is correct</li>
        <li>Defining every endpoint to need maximum privileges, unless told otherwise so the developer always need to
            think about which roles are allowed to do the thing they intent to do
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        For my authorization, I used JWT. This token is encrypted with RSA, so impossible to change the values
        (<a href="randd">R&D project</a>).
    </p>

    <h1>
        6. Security misconfiguration
    </h1>
    <p>
        Misconfiguring some aspects in a network can be a big problem. If the firewall is misconfigured and the wrong
        ports are open, people can get access to the network from the outside. Other examples can be that the errors are
        too verbose and display the whole stracktrace, which will result in extra information given away where
        vulnerabilities can be found.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Let a red team test your application</li>
        <li>Document every choice you make while configuring your system</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        I have made a mistake in the firewall in my R&D project: the red teamers had access to my portainer. So by
        letting them test my application, I found this bug and I could easily solve it.
    </p>

    <h1>
        7. Cross-Site Scripting XSS
    </h1>
    <p>
        XSS is adding a line of script to someone else's application to run these scripts on the victim's computer.
        There are three types of XSS: stored, reflected and DOM. Stored XSS is that a line of script can be stored
        inside the application database and is executed every time that it is requested. Reflected XSS is that someone
        enters the XSS in the URL which can result into phishing attacks, since the URL is the URL of the requested
        website. The third form of XSS is DOM. DOM based XSS is entering XSS in a search bar for example. This data will
        never leave your browser and has the least risk of doing something wrong.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Using trusted frameworks and keeping them up-to-date</li>
        <li>Validating every input/output field</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        For my application, I used a javascript framework: Angular. Angular automatically validates all input and XSS
        will not be possible as long as I do not do something weird with the data. In the challenge page, a certain type
        of formatting needs to be used. So I used a library to use markdown instead of HTML. This way XSS is also not
        possible here.
    </p>

    <h1>
        8. Insecure Deserialization
    </h1>
    <p>
        To change data in the request sent to the API, you can get remote code execution to change certain fields and
        get you privileges you normally shouldn't get.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Using frameworks that have solved this issue and not trying to do things yourself</li>
        <li>Enforcing strict object policy</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        I use Spring Boot, which automatically will solve this issue and thus will not be any problem for me.
    </p>

    <h1>
        9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
    </h1>
    <p>
        If a vulnerability is found in a framework you are using and you don't update your system with the latest patch,
        you will get exploited.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Constantly update your systems</li>
        <li>Constant vulnerability watchers which will notify you when a vulnerability is found in a framework</li>
        <li>Automatically updating your systems</li>
        <li>Check if the frameworks that you are using are trusted</li>
        <li>Don't use experimental versions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        I always use the latest versions of a library when creating my code.
    </p>

    <h1>
        10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
    </h1>
    <p>
        When a vulnerability is found and there are people in your system, it is key that you throw them out of your
        system as soon as possible. If you don't know that they are in your systems, you haven't logged enough.
        Everything people do on your systems should be logged so you can always see what's going wrong. Also a blue team
        should constantly monitor your application, so you can see what's going wrong.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Counters
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Log everything on every level</li>
        <li>Have a blue team monitor your application</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        R&D
    </h2>
    <p>
        For my application, I log most of my things. I've installed multiple tools to log on system level and send that
        data to the blue team, but I've also logged most things on application level. This application level part I
        monitored myself.
