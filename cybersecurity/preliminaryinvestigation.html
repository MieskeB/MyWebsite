    <p>
        In the chart above, three threats can be seen. I think these are the most important treats.
    </p>
    <p>
        The impact level is defined with five different values:
        <br/>
        &bull; Negligible
        <br/>
        &bull; Low
        <br/>
        &bull; Medium
        <br/>
        &bull; High
        <br/>
        &bull; Very high
        <br/>
        I divided these values by saying that medium is a bug that the players won't feel (much) but needs to be fixed
        as soon as possible. High will mean a bug that is required to solve immediately and the players will feel that
        it's there. Very high means that the CTF must be ended immediately without declaring a winner and everyone can
        go home. The other way around for the low and negligible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Probability is the likeliness that the threat will happen in the CTF. These are defined in three different
        values:
        <br/>
        &bull; Low
        <br/>
        &bull; Medium
        <br/>
        &bull; High
        <br/>
        In this chart, low means that it most likely won't happen, medium means that it won't happen every CTF but some
        and high means it will most probably happen every CTF.
    </p>
    <p>
        The level security controls is defined as a combination of impact level and probability. This will tell how
        important it is to look into this and make sure it doesn't happen. This will be defined in the following ways:
        <br/>
        &bull; Standard
        <br/>
        &bull; Moderate
        <br/>
        &bull; High
        <br/>
        &bull; Very high
        <br/>
        If the impact is low or negligible or if the probability is low, the level of security controls is standard. If
        impact and probability is both medium, the level of security controls is moderate. If one of them is medium and
        the other high, the level of security controls is high. In any other case, the level of security controls is
        very high.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CTF will only be hosted onsite for a few hours, so most 'normal' threats will not be a problem. I did choose
        the following threats that could happen when keeping an on-site CTF:
        <br/>
        &bull; DDoS
        <br/>
        &bull; Stealing confidential business data
        <br/>
        &bull; Bruteforce flags
    </p>
    <p>
        DDoS is most likely to happen, since a lot of people will join at once. This can be countered by using a proper
        scaling method. Because the CTF is so short, if there is downtime, this wouldn't be a fun CTF.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stealing confidential business data (like flags or challenge writeups) is very important not to happen. If this
        happens, the CTF becomes unplayable and won't be fun for everyone. This can be solved by hashing the flags and
        storing the writeups in a secure location.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bruteforce flags is very important not to happen. To solve this, good ruling should be applied as well as
        logging/monitoring if someone does this. Another solution is to increase the responsetime after every wrong
        request.

        Confidentiality is how confidential the data is using the following scale:
        <br/>
        &bull; Public
        <br/>
        &bull; Internal use
        <br/>
        &bull; Confidential
        <br/>
        &bull; Classified
    </p>
    <p>
        Integrity is how much we can guarantee that the confidentiality is kept the way it is. This is also defined into
        a scale:
        <br/>
        &bull; Unimportant
        <br/>
        &bull; Protected
        <br/>
        &bull; High
        <br/>
        &bull; Guaranteed
    </p>
    <p>
        Availability is how much of thee time the data is available. This is defined in the following scale:
        <br/>
        &bull; Not necessary
        <br/>
        &bull; Important
        <br/>
        &bull; Required
        <br/>
        &bull; Essential
    </p>
    <p>
        Privacy is the part if the data can be accessed by other users. This is defined in the following scale:
        <br/>
        &bull; Public
        <br/>
        &bull; Personal
        <br/>
