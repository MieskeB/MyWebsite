                I love developing projects. I sometimes create a project myself at home. This is the reason why I picked the security engineering part. The combination between software development and cyber security. I always love to develop secure login systems and secure authorization, since every time I do this, something new pops up. Also afterwards trying to hack into the system I just created, is something I like very much.

                Goals (must haves)
            </div>
            <div class="project_description">
                &bull; Find a couple of vacancies for security engineering jobs on application level and on system/networking/cloud level. Analyze the required skills and described tasks and responsibilities. Compare them with you learning plan and update you learning goals and activities, explain your findings and updates in your portfolio.
				&bull; Make a misuse case (or abuse case) design for an IT system, service or application that you are developing. See [5][6] as a starting point for study. Start with a global use case diagram of your IT system (or application). Research and add the best counter measures on application, system Ã¡nd network level to your design to prevent the misuse cases.
				&bull; Learn the standard security principles and write a blog on your portfolio with examples of these security principles. 
				&bull; Fix some security bugs in an application or system environment. (For example the results from the first Red Team vs. Blue Team event). Report on the bugs and your fixes in your portfolio. 
				&bull; Learn the syntax and options of regular expressions and apply some regular expressions for input filtering in a test application. Watch [9] as a starting point.
				&bull; Perform the AES encryption operations (See [6], SubBytes, ShiftRows, etc.) manually on one block of 128-bits data with a 128-bit (round) key. Start with the data block in a 16 byte state and apply the four AES-operations on the state. Add a link to your portfolio page on cryptography to an appendix with the calculations.
				&bull; Implement data encryption on application code level. Select a trusted cryptographic library for your programming language, find/select a use case for data encryption and implement the data encryption with the use of AES and the best fit block chaining method. Be aware of the difficulty of secure key handling (you don't want to hard code keys in your code) and find a good way to solve this problem. Explain your approach and the essential coding snippets and an example of execution of the code in your portfolio.
				&bull; Learn the mathematical basics of RSA (and Diffie Hellman) public key cryptography : Modular arithmetic ([5] par.1.4.1), the (extended) Euclidean algorithm (par.6.3.1, 6.3.2), Euler's phi-function (6.3.3), Fermat's and Euler's theorem (6.3.4). Add a link to your portfolio page on cryptography to an appendix with some relevant calculations.
				&bull; Add security logging to your design, implementation and testing. Design: Add a list of security related events, the logging technology, code example, log message format. Implementation: Add a standard logging mechanism in your code, add the log events. Testing: test for the log events to be triggered, check if the logging is done correctly. 
				&bull; Look for static code (security) analysis tools, select one for the programming language(s) your are working with. Perform a static code analysis and (1) analyse, discuss your findings with a fellow student and report on the findings, (2) design and implement improvements in your code. Examples of such tools focussing on security: RATS (for C and Python code), Bandit (for Python code) and Safety (for used Python libraries).
				&bull; Review the source code of an open source tool, app, or application. Perform both a static code analysis with tools, as well as a manual code review. Report on your findings to the developers of the open source code and add your approach, review and findings to your portfolio.
				&bull; Review the secure configuration of a system environment (servers, clients, network). Report on your findings to the developers of the environment and add your approach, review and findings to your portfolio.
				&bull; Add fuzzing tests for an application that you are developing, for example in the form of unit tests. Create fuzzing tests aimed at discovering buffer overflow issues and Denial of Service issues. If you are developing a webapplication you could also add fuzzing tests for XSS and/or SQL injection (with a list of XSS and/or SQLi testing vectors).
				
				&bull; Pick an IT application or service to develop to be able to learn and apply all security engineering aspects. Pick an application that needs security and that could be an actual operational environment, e.g. a CTF platform, an information system for a SOC, a web platform thats stores sensitive or confidential data, etc. Give a general description of the application in your portfolio: main functionality, users and user groups, global system architecture. Install one or more server in your personal seclab account for development and testing of this very secure application. This server environment will be used for the Red Tem - Blue Team event where the security of your application is tested (Red Team) and monitored (Blue Team). Note: You can also (partly) use the system environment and application for your project and use that for the exercise/challenges that fit the project. 
				&bull; Apply all security by design steps and techniques in your R&D project:
				- gather and discuss security requirements 
				- define security threats for the system to develop and perform a risk analysis.
				- put the threats in a secure design through misuse cases.
				- work out security controls to limit the threats in your misuse cases
				- implement the security controls
				- test the security controls by developing test cases for the threats. Add fuzzing tests.
				&bull; Join the Red Team - Blue Team test event! Deploy your developed system (application(s), servers, tooling, network functionality) in an operational testing environment. Configure your system and application logs to be send to a central log server or SIEM server in the combined test environment. Ask the blue teaming students how they can receive your logs (technology, portnumber, secure channel)
