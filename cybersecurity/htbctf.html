        Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
        Ron (a teacher) came to us asking if we'd like to join the Fontys FHICT team in this HTB CTF. I always love to
        play CTFs, so I told him I was in. Ron asked me to be the team leader, so I took this role upon me. While doing
        the CTF, I managed to help several people with their challenges, and I also solved a challenge myself (Buggy
        Time Machine) with some help of another team member. The writeup of this challenge is found in this document.

        Buggy Time Machine

    <p>
        After having a look at the Python code they gave us, we found out that the next year is calculated with the
        following formula:
    </p>
    <p>
        Next year = (current year * m + c) mod n
    </p>
    <p>
        We did not have the values m, c and n, so we had to find them on our own. The n should be the highest value
        possible + 1, so we ran a script (in Java) that gets a lot of years and printed the highest value we found:
    </p>
    <img src="../assets/img/ctfbtm1.png" alt="find largest and smallest"/>
    <p>
        After running this for a while, we found that the highest value was almost the maximum integer. We assumed that
        this would be the n value: 2147483647. Since we have current year and next year two times, we can calculate the
        m and c. With the following script:
    </p>
    <img src="../assets/img/ctfbtm2.png" alt="find m and c"/>
    <p>
        We did the calculation with random values and tested it on another query. That way we found out that the m
        should be 48271 and the c should be 0. This means that c can be removed from the query to make it a bit easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we can start with calculating the next year with the following script:
    </p>
    <img src="../assets/img/ctfbtm3.png" alt="calculate next year"/>
    <p>
        When typing the solution in the request 'predict_year' we get the number of hops returned (876578) and we now
        know our formula is correct.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the TravelTo2020 function requires a seed and not a predicted year, we need to invert this formula. This
        is very difficult since there is a modulo in this formula. After some thinking and calculating, we found the
        following formula:
    </p>
    <p>
        Current year = ((z * n + next year) / m) mod n --&gt; IF (z * n + next year) mod m == 0
    </p>
    <p>
        In this formula, z is a value that needs to be filled in randomly. This translates into the following piece of
        code:
    </p>
    <img src="../assets/img/ctfbtm4.png" alt="calculate previous year"/>
    <p>
        Now we need to use this formula to calculate 876578 hops back. Just place above function in a loop for the
        required amount of hops:
    </p>
    <img src="../assets/img/ctfbtm5.png" alt="calculate previous year 876578 times"/>
    <p>
        This gives the correct seed. This needs to be returned to the API and then it returns the flag:
    </p>
    <p>
        HTB{l1n34r_c0n9ru3nc35_4nd_prn91Zz}
    </p>
