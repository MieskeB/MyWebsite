    <h1>
        CORS
    </h1>
    <p>
        A classmate had a problem with sending requests from his Angular frontend to his Spring Boot API. Since I have a
        lot of experience in this combination of frontend and backend, he asked me what was wrong. After having a look
        to the application code, I found out that his CORS configuration was absent. Having worked with Spring Boot, I
        had a solution ready in one of my older repositories and sent it to him, which solved the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        A few weeks later, another classmate asked me a similar question. This time he had a valid CORS configuration.
        After a lot of debugging and sending the request, I found out that the API didn't accept the extra header that
        was added to the request. Then the solution was easy: adding exposedHeader to the CORS configuration file.
    </p>

    <h1>
        Setting up Docker Swarm
    </h1>
    <p>
        A classmate told me that he had problems setting up Kubernetes. So I told him that I don't have experience with
        Kubernetes, but I did have an easy solution: use Docker Swarm. I did warn him that Docker Swarm stated that you
        should not use it in production mode. But due to lack of time, he decided he wanted to install it anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
        I helped him with the installation of Docker Swarm. I also helped him with explaining how docker-compose worked
        and sent him my docker-compose file. He modified my docker-compose file and uploaded it to his own server. From
        this point everything was working properly.
    </p>

    <h1>
        Reflection
    </h1>
    <p>
        I love to share my own knowledge. Everything I know, I want to help people with. But when I can't solve a
        problem, I sometimes tend to say that I just don't know it. Afterwards I help them Google some, but I tend to
        give up sometimes on it. This is something that needs working on in upcoming years.
